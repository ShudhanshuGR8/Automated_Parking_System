The automated parking system was created to solve people's problems
when parking their vehicles. The project's goal is to display a
single-vehicle in a specified parking place, therefore streamlining
the process. This may be implemented by detecting and recognizing
the license plate and keeping a parking slot database. It will also
make it easier for parking lot guards to issue tokens to car owners.
